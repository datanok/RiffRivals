# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Dhwani is a collaborative music creation app built on the Devvit platform that transforms Reddit's threaded reply system into an asynchronous jam session experience. Users can create musical "Riffs" as custom posts, layer additional instruments through replies, and build complex musical compositions through Reddit's natural threading structure. The app leverages Tone.js for client-side audio synthesis and Devvit's UI components for instrument interfaces.
